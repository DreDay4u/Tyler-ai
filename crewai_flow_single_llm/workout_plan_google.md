# Daily Workout Plan

Daily plan: Wake up at 6:00 AM. Morning (e.g., 6:30 AM - 7:15 AM): Dedicated workout time (e.g., strength training, cardio, or a run contributing to your 5 miles/week goal). Structure the rest of the day around meals, work/activities, and downtime. Aim to wind down for bedtime by 8:00 PM.
